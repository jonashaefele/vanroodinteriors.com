<h3>
    Having segued into the interiors world after deciding to turn a personal interest into a professional venture and studying at the Interior Design School, London, I have recently worked on the rebranding and relaunch of Native Apartments, and with Conran Interiors as lead designer of an apartment complex in Hoxton.
</h3>

<h3>
    With over twenty years of working as a graphic designer and art director specialising in lifestyle and hospitality and working with advertising and marketing agencies including Maverick Design, Native Apartments, Taylor Wessing and M&C Saatchi, plus a portfolio of clients such as DHL, Virgin, Conran, Costa Coffee, Knight Frank and Hilton I have a proven project track record within the industry.
</h3>

<h3>
    With my own office I can either work in-house or remotely, host meetings or group work sessions. By working directly with Vanrood Ltd, I can offer competitive day and project rates either for myself or a larger team and avoid recruitment agency costs working in an efficient and cost effective manner fitting for the times.

<section class="about">
  <p>
    Born and based in London, with qualifications in Graphic Design and Interior
    Design I loosely describe myself as a Conceptual Creative, working with
    branding agencies, marketing teams and individual clients to provide design
    concepts, strategy, management and roll-out.

  <p>
    Influenced by architecture, construction, textiles and anthropology, I
    believe good design solutions come from persistence, planning, teamwork and
    encouragement.

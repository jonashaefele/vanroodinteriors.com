    </p>

    <p>
      After conducting extensive research into each building’s heritage,
      architecture, and local area history, I created a unique emblem for each
      property, and proposed concepts for external and internal signage.
      Threading this content into bespoke typographic and illustrative wall
      murals, I curated the lobby spaces to enrich the guest experience and lift
      the interiors.
    </p>

    <p>
      A series of wall plaques, external signage and wayfinding signage was
      successfully rolled out across the property portfolio, inceasing brand
      awareness and cementing Native as part of the fabric of the community.

      Project management included site visits, conceptual designs, planning
      applications, supplier liaison, artwork production and installation
      supervision.

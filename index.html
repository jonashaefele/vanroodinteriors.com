          <h3>Empire Warehouse</h3>

              >Propose a creative direction to reflect both the building’s
              history as a Victorian Warehouse, and it’s contemporary purpose as
              a cluster of mixed use businesses, incorporating a brand new
              flagship Apart-Hotel.</i
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            After conducting extensive research into the local area, referencing
            content from archaeological reports and architects’ plans, I created
            a modern aesthetic identity with strong links to the listed
            building’s heritage, created branded guest 'goodie bags', and
            launched a new 'guest pantry' concept containing locally sourced
            products and groceries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working alongside architects and interior designers, I curated
            communal spaces including the Guest Pantry and Lobby area, using
            materials and furnishings carefully selected to sympathetically
            blend with traditional and new architectural additions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The initial proposal was eventually replaced with a more modest
            branding exercise as part of a wider rebrand project, and Empire
            Warehouse became Native Bankside.

                      I was commissioned by Cuckooz Apartments to lead the interior design
                      of their newest and largest property, as part of a collaboration
                      with well established procurement specialists Conran Interiors.

                      Retaining their playful & youthful brand aesthetic I created a
                      sophisticated theme including unique mid-century pieces and high
                      quality accent coloured furniture, to balance with the existing
                      neutral marble interiors and white washed walls.

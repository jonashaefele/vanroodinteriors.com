                      Propose a creative direction to reflect both the building’s
                      history as a Victorian Warehouse, and it’s contemporary purpose as
                      a cluster of mixed use businesses, incorporating a brand new
                      flagship ApartHotel.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After conducting extensive research into the local area, referencing
                    content from archaeological reports and architects’ plans, I created
                    a modern aesthetic identity with strong links to the listed
                    building’s heritage, created branded guest 'goodie bags', and
                    launched a new 'guest pantry' concept containing locally sourced
                    products and groceries.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Working alongside architects and interior designers, I curated
                    communal spaces including the Guest Pantry and Lobby area, using
                    materials and furnishings carefully selected to sympathetically
                    blend with traditional and new architectural additions.

              <h3>Native Apartments</h3>


              <p>
              Stylise and shoot over 30 apartments across 14 properties in
                  various London locations, capturing the space, versatility,
                  location, amenities and uniqueness of each apartment.
              </p>

              <p>
                As part of a wider rebrand project, the photography was primarily
                required for a new, rebranded, image led e-commerce website,
                designed to promote the eclectic nature of the portfolio, highlight
                the benefits, and increase bookings.
              </p>

              <p>
                Working within a limited budget and tight timescales, I sourced a
                series of versatile props for the entire shoot to replacing the
                previous somewhat sterile photography, and create lifestyle themes
                throughout.
              </p>

              <p>
                A balance of 5-6 images per apartment was struck to minimise load
                time, while highlighting the uniqueness of each property, and it’s
                facileness by capturing colours, materials, work spaces, large
                bedrooms, fully equipped kitchens & dining spaces.

                    <p><i>
                      A new residential development located in Old
                      Street, London.

                    <p>
                      Commissioned as lead Interior Designer by Cuckooz Apartments
                      in collaboration with globally renowned Conran Interiors, I oversaw all aspects of design,
                      procurement and installation for 12 rental apartments of varying size and layout.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Retaining their playful and youthful brand aesthetic, I created a
                      sophisticated theme including unique mid-century pieces and high
                      quality accent coloured furniture, to balance with the existing
                      neutral marble interiors and white washed walls.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The artwork is each apartment was conceived, designed, printed, framed and positioned by myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Launching in early 2019, this landmark property’s interior has bene
                      widely praised, thus creating desirable homes for their target
                      market.

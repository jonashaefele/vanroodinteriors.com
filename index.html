                          history as a Victorian Warehouse, and it’s contemporary purpose as
                          a cluster of mixed use businesses, incorporating a brand new
                          flagship ApartHotel.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After conducting extensive research into the local area, referencing
                    content from archaeological reports and architects’ plans, I created
                    a modern aesthetic identity with strong links to the listed
                    building’s heritage, created branded guest 'goodie bags', and
                    launched a new 'guest pantry' concept containing locally sourced
                    products and groceries.

                  <p>
                    Working alongside architects and interior designers, I curated
                    communal spaces including the Guest Pantry and Lobby area, using
                    materials and furnishings carefully selected to sympathetically
                    blend with traditional and new architectural additions.

                    <p>A collector of unique artefacts and personal items, and an eclectic wardrobe (catering for hikes, conferences, leisure and work), David requires adaptable and functional storage space to display or store these objects, avoiding a ‘clinical gallery space’ atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>The interior must maximise the limited space, natural light, balcony access & views, by creating practical zones, comfortable spaces to relax, read, cook and sleep, with uncluttered ample storage space, practical surfaces. </p>

                    <p>Respecting the humble 1970’s planning, design and architecture, the kitchen and bathroom should have functional fixtures and fittings, be as spacious as possible, while minimising impact on the overall layout.

              <p>
                As part of a wider rebrand project, the photography was primarily
                required for a new, rebranded, image-led e-commerce website,
                designed to promote the eclectic nature of the portfolio and increase bookings.
              </p>

              <p>
                Working within a limited budget and timescale, I sourced a
                series of versatile props for the entire shoot, creating realistically curated lifestyle themes
                appropriate for each location.
              </p>

              <p>
                A balance of 5-6 images per apartment was struck to minimise load
                time, while highlighting the uniqueness of each property by capturing architectural details, highlighting variety, and celebrating the work spaces, fully equipped kitchens, spacious bedrooms, lounge spaces and dining spaces.

          <p><i>An academic design concept.

        <p>Situated in a former office block, the building naturally reflects the architectural norms of the late 1960s.</p>
        <p>Capitalising on these inherited design attributes, and with the help of some well considered architectural modifications, Hotel viajó must take influence from this celebrated period of interior design to create a sense of modernity, progression, comfort and serenity.</p>
        <p>Delicately placing Hotel Viajó into the 21st century, a mixed use of original and modern pieces is encouraged, and hidden technology must work seamlessly with atypical materials, textures, lighting, furniture and layout.</p>
        <p>The target audience of 35-50 year will have exposure to the abundant luxury available in 2018, expecting the highest quality design and finishes, whilst taking pleasure in the element of surprise and joy.</p>
        <p>Clerkenwell offers a more sedate guest experience, surrounded by history, with an abundance of restaurant and bar options, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of modern London.</p>
